Frontend (Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS):

Next.js: For server-side rendering, routing, and overall frontend application structure.
TypeScript: For static typing, which can help catch errors during development.
Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling.
Backend (Python with SQL):

Python: For your backend logic, including web scraping and handling database operations.
Flask or Django: Flask is lightweight and easy to set up, while Django provides a more comprehensive framework.
SQL (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL): For storing scraped data.
Communication between Frontend and Backend:

You can have your frontend and backend communicate through RESTful APIs or GraphQL. Flask or Django can be used to set up API endpoints that your Next.js frontend can consume.
Database:

Use SQL databases like SQLite or PostgreSQL to store and retrieve scraped data.
Deployment:

Deploy your Next.js frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
Deploy your Python backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
Communication Between Frontend and Backend:

Set up API routes in your Python backend (using Flask or Django) to handle requests from your Next.js frontend.
Use asynchronous requests or technologies like Axios to communicate between frontend and backend.
