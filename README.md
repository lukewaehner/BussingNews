To Work on:
Finished being able to pull stuff from DB
Need to sync python scripts to the main DB or connext the two, and ficure out how to not get overlaps
Lots of brainstorming needed
Async server since can be updated by users on refresh? 

Also idk how to get this into prod
Have to figure how to point everything to the right address, proxy? cbos?
